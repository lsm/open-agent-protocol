// Client is a connected Makai runtime. It owns the child process and the
// frame routing for every call made through its namespaces.
//
// A Client is safe for concurrent use: calls on different streams and
// sessions are multiplexed over the one transport, and ordering is guaranteed
// within a stream or session but not between them.
//
// Always call [Client.Close] when finished; it terminates the runtime and
// releases the SDK's goroutines.

// lifetime: once New returns, cancelling ctx does not close the client.

// call more than once: later calls return the first call's result.
