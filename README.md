# Open Agent Protocol

Draft public-domain semantic protocol for agent software layers, agent loops,
model IO, tools, resources, and adapters for existing agent SDKs.

The first conformance target is an agent-control core covering the boundary
between a control layer and an agent loop: capabilities, session state, message
submission, run lifecycle, streamed content, cancellation, and state recovery
without binding to a specific transport.

OAP layers are logical software boundaries, not deployment sides. A
presentation layer, control layer, agent loop, model provider, tool executor,
resource provider, and binding can live in one process or across multiple
transports while preserving the same protocol semantics. Adapters for existing
SDKs or protocols are implementation shims, not a separate semantic layer.

Current drafts:

- [Conformance Draft](drafts/conformance.md)
- [Presentation Control Profile](drafts/presentation-control-profile.md)
- [Agent Control Core](drafts/agent-control-core.md)
- [Agent Control Profile](drafts/agent-control-profile.md)
- [Layered Agent Protocol](drafts/layered-agent-protocol.md)

Protocol artifacts:

- [Illustrative protocol envelopes](examples/README.md)
- `fixtures/`: normative executable conformance traces
- `schema/v0.1/`: JSON Schema bundle for the agent-control core

Executable core (Go 1.24 or later):

```sh
go run ./cmd/oap check
```

The command validates positive and negative fixtures and drives the deterministic
in-memory reference adapter. The reference adapter proves the public adapter
boundary and bounded process-memory recovery; it is not a production harness or
a durable persistence implementation.

Research:

- [Harness interoperability study](research/harness-interoperability.md)
- [P0 protocol gaps from harness interoperability](research/p0-protocol-gaps.md)
- [Pinned Codex app-server mapping](research/codex-app-server-8d7cc24-mapping.md)
- [Pinned ACP v1 and Devin Desktop mapping](research/acp-v1.7.0-mapping.md)
- [Z.ai China Coding Plan evidence matrix](research/zai-china-coding-plan-evidence.md)

Provider compatibility is tested independently from harness conformance. Inspect
the credential-free China Coding Plan presets with:

```sh
go run ./cmd/oap providers zai-cn
```

Ordinary tests use fake credentials and loopback provider servers. Credentialed
provider evidence is separately and explicitly gated as documented in the matrix;
credential presence alone never enables network traffic.

The repository is dedicated under CC0-1.0 so any presentation layer, control
layer, agent loop, model provider, tool executor, resource provider, tool
source, or SDK adapter can implement the protocol without project-specific
licensing friction.
