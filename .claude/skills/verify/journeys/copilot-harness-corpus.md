## Shared Copilot CLI corpus

Use the shared build/tool setup in `SKILL.md`, then run from the root:

```sh
python3 .claude/skills/verify/scripts/copilot-harness-corpus.py --output-dir /tmp/oap-copilot-corpus-<unique-name>
```

Zig's production native decoder and reducer replay every manifest case against
fixed expected OAP: text, queued runs sharing one busy period, accumulated usage,
tool success/denial, session errors, foreign sessions and unknown events. Reasoning
is explicitly observed without a published projection. Malformed JSON-RPC and
malformed event bodies must be rejected by the native codec, with no OAP events.
The script wraps each event sequence with its checked-in admission exchange and
runs the public Go and oapx validators. Require exit 0 and `PASS`; inspect
`zig-replay.txt`, the full trace and both validator outputs. The replay also
refuses a mislabeled outbound response, so its direction is part of the contract.

The pin is CLI 1.0.98 / protocol 3; source and artifact provenance come from the
existing ledger. This is synthetic schema/ledger-based data, not a new live
recording. It starts no Copilot process, uses no token, and performs no model
call. Go's native JSON-RPC decoder now consumes the same ten cases, preserves
unknown event names and exact numeric source bytes, and rejects duplicate keys
and ambiguous message shapes. Inspect `go-native.txt` for its result. This does
not yet claim a runnable Go adapter: process transport and reducer follow in
later slices. Unsupported host capabilities remain unadvertised; the Rust lane
follows separately.
