# Plan: Zig 0.15.2 → 0.16.0 Migration Decomposition

## Goal summary

Deliver a concrete, reviewable implementation plan for migrating Makai from Zig 0.15.2 to Zig 0.16.0 based on the approved impact assessment in `docs/zig-0.16.0-upgrade-impact-assessment.md`. The migration proceeds through an explicit architecture-decision prerequisite, preparation wrappers/tests on Zig 0.15.2, a green compiler/dependency baseline PR, core/std fixes, I/O/provider/OAuth/transport migration, and final Zig 0.16 validation. The primary implementation deliverable is `docs/zig-0.16.0-migration-plan.md`, which decomposes the work into single-PR tasks with dependency ordering, risk mitigations, rollback strategy, and remaining clarification points.

## Work items

1. **Decide Zig 0.16 I/O architecture and ownership model**  
   Priority: **urgent**  
   Make the default `std.Io` backend and ownership model an up-front architecture decision before wrapper work starts. The binding default for dispatch is that Phase 0 wrappers MUST NOT expose `std.Io` in public API signatures; public constructors use Makai-owned context/default-I/O patterns, while internal helpers may accept explicit I/O handles when needed. Document wrapper naming conventions and parameter order so dependent PRs are consistent.

2. **Add I/O compatibility design skeleton**  
   Priority: **high**  
   Create the base compatibility module and build wiring for time, sleep, random, filesystem/stdio, HTTP, and networking seams. Keep it Zig 0.15.2-compatible and document how each seam should map to the architecture decision from work item 1. This creates a shared foundation for parallel Phase 0 wrapper PRs.

3. **Add time and sleep wrappers on Zig 0.15.2**  
   Priority: **high**  
   Introduce helpers for wall-clock timestamps, monotonic time, and sleeping using current `std.time` and `std.Thread.sleep` APIs. Migrate representative low-risk call sites only. These wrappers become the post-switch location for `std.Io.Timestamp`, `Io.Clock`, `Duration`, and timeout behavior.

4. **Add random and secure-random wrappers on Zig 0.15.2**  
   Priority: **high**  
   Add helpers that distinguish security-sensitive entropy from ordinary random bytes. The wrappers should support later migration of both PKCE modules (`zig/src/oauth/pkce.zig` and `zig/src/utils/oauth/pkce.zig`), OAuth state, WebSocket nonce/masks, protocol IDs, and storage temporary names. Phase 0 may add non-failing inventory/reporting for direct `std.crypto.random` usage, but must not make `check-zig-patterns.sh` fail until the bulk call-site migration in work item 14.

5. **Add filesystem and stdio helper layer on Zig 0.15.2**  
   Priority: **high**  
   Add wrappers around cwd/open/read/write/atomic rename, stdin/stdout, and file reader/writer operations. The initial implementation should use 0.15.2 `std.fs`/`std.io` while preserving existing behavior. Atomic replacement acceptance criteria include same-directory temp files for same-filesystem rename, final `0o600` credential-file mode where supported, no truncation before successful rename, and temp-file cleanup on failure where possible.

6. **Add HTTP client/request abstraction on Zig 0.15.2**  
   Priority: **high**  
   Define a thin abstraction over provider/OAuth HTTP client creation, request sending, response body reading, and streaming. The goal is to hide Zig 0.16 `std.http.Client{ .io = ... }` and new request-flow changes behind one project API. Validate the shape with a test double; production provider rollout is split into later PRs.

7. **Add networking helper layer on Zig 0.15.2**  
   Priority: **normal**  
   Create wrappers for TCP connect, address resolution, listen/accept, and stream read/write operations used by WebSocket transport and OAuth callback server. Keep the implementation backed by `std.net` until the compiler switch. Add loopback or unit tests that do not depend on external services.

8. **Add focused regression tests before semantic migration**  
   Priority: **high**  
   Expand named tests for EventStream completion-after-error, double-completion, timeout, multi-producer stress, and memory ordering; OAuth storage production `saveToFile`, `0o600` mode, same-directory temp rename, and cleanup; WebSocket masking-key XOR and continuation reassembly; SSE 1-byte incremental reads and error-body injection; provider cancellation across pre-request, connect/setup, headers, between events, and mid-event; and retry/time zero-timeout, large-timeout, overflow, and budget exhaustion. These tests must run on Zig 0.15.2 and become the measurable gate before Phase 1 dispatch. Avoid external provider E2E tests.

9. **Switch to a first green Zig 0.16 baseline PR and remove libxev**  
   Priority: **urgent**  
   Update Zig/CI metadata and remove the currently declared libxev dependency. A repo scan found `libxev` only in `zig/build.zig.zon` and docs; `zig/build.zig` does not call `b.dependency("libxev", ...)`, and source files do not import `xev`/`libxev`. Phase 1 must remove the unused declaration rather than update/pin it. Apply enough compile-restoring fixes for all required PR CI jobs to pass, including the current unit-test matrix and TS SDK E2E; include `test-unit-makai-cli` too if CI adds it.

10. **Migrate `std.mem.indexOf*` call sites to `std.mem.find*`**  
    Priority: **high**  
    Replace all `std.mem.indexOf`, `indexOfScalar`, `indexOfAny`, and `indexOfPos` usages with the correct Zig 0.16 `find` family. This high-volume mechanical work should be isolated to reduce noise in deeper I/O PRs. Verify exact replacement names against Zig 0.16.0.

11. **Migrate core EventStream and stream synchronization**  
    Priority: **high**  
    Port synchronization in `zig/src/event_stream.zig` and `zig/src/stream.zig` from `std.Thread.Futex`/related primitives to Zig 0.16-compatible `std.Io.*` primitives or suitable equivalents. Keep this PR focused on central streaming semantics only. Use the regression tests from work item 8 to validate wake, timeout, completion, polling, and error behavior, and preserve existing stream error messages/error types unless a compiler-enforced change is documented.

12. **Migrate agent/auth/OAuth synchronization**  
    Priority: **high**  
    Port synchronization in `zig/src/agent/agent.zig`, `zig/src/protocol/auth/server.zig`, and `zig/src/utils/oauth/refresh_lock.zig` separately from core EventStream work. This isolates auth/agent coordination review from lock-free stream review. Validate refresh coordination, auth protocol locking, and agent event completion behavior.

13. **Migrate time, sleep, and timestamp call sites through wrappers**  
    Priority: **high**  
    Convert remaining direct timestamp and sleep calls to the project wrapper API. Update wrapper implementations to use the chosen Zig 0.16 `std.Io` time primitives. Preserve wall-clock versus monotonic semantics explicitly and verify OAuth token-expiry arithmetic remains identical on Zig 0.16 for representative and boundary inputs.

14. **Migrate random and protocol/OAuth ID generation**  
    Priority: **high**  
    Update random wrappers to use Zig 0.16 `io.random`, `io.randomSecure`, or `std.Random.IoSource` as appropriate. Migrate both PKCE modules (`zig/src/oauth/pkce.zig:14` and `zig/src/utils/oauth/pkce.zig:19`), OAuth state, WebSocket masks/nonces, protocol IDs, and storage temporary names; deduplicate PKCE helper logic or document why both paths remain separate while sharing secure entropy. After these call sites migrate, enable the failing pattern guardrail so production code cannot reintroduce direct `std.crypto.random` usage and security-sensitive paths cannot use `io.random`/non-secure wrappers instead of secure entropy.

15. **Migrate ArrayList, formatting, custom JSON writer, and std.json drift**  
    Priority: **high**  
    Fix container and writer API compile errors after the compiler switch. Convert only compile-confirmed `std.ArrayList` breakages and migrate `std.fmt.format` uses in the custom JSON writer/protocol envelope code. Validate `std.json` parse/stringify APIs through protocol/provider/utils tests.

16. **Migrate OAuth credential storage filesystem operations**  
    Priority: **high**  
    Port OAuth credential storage to Zig 0.16 filesystem helpers as its own user-data-focused PR. Preserve atomic replacement, directory creation, missing-file behavior, permissions expectations, rollback/backup safety, startup cleanup of stale orphaned `.tmp.*` files where safe, and existing storage error messages/error types unless a compiler-enforced change is documented. Address credential memory zeroing for `Credentials.deinit()` and `ProviderAuth.deinit()` if practical while touching storage; otherwise file a named security-debt follow-up documenting that sensitive slices are still freed without zeroing.

17. **Migrate stdio transport and CLI file I/O**  
    Priority: **high**  
    Port stdio transport and CLI file operations to Zig 0.16 filesystem/stdio helpers. Keep this separate from OAuth credential storage so transport/CLI review does not obscure user-data safety. Validate transport and CLI-related unit tests, plus CLI output formatting, exit codes, and auth-flow prompts.

18. **Migrate shared HTTP abstraction and one proving provider**  
    Priority: **urgent**  
    Port the shared HTTP abstraction to Zig 0.16's `std.Io`-aware request/response flow and migrate exactly one representative streaming provider as the proving provider. The proving provider should exercise request bodies, response head handling, incremental body reads, SSE parsing, provider error-body handling, and cancellation during connect/setup, headers, between SSE events, and mid-event payload. Preserve auth-header construction/forwarding semantics for API keys, bearer tokens, OAuth tokens, and provider-specific headers, and preserve existing provider error messages/error types unless a compiler-enforced change is documented.

19. **Migrate remaining OpenAI/Azure provider HTTP implementations**  
    Priority: **high**  
    Migrate OpenAI Completions, OpenAI Responses, and Azure OpenAI Responses providers through the proven shared HTTP abstraction. Keep request/response formatting changes limited to what Zig 0.16 requires. Run provider unit tests and mock/non-secret tests.

20. **Migrate remaining Anthropic/Google/Ollama provider HTTP implementations**  
    Priority: **high**  
    Migrate Anthropic Messages, Google Generative, Google Vertex, and Ollama providers through the proven shared HTTP abstraction. Preserve streaming, SSE parsing, cancellation, thinking blocks, and provider-specific error handling. Run provider unit tests and mock/non-secret tests.

21. **Migrate OAuth HTTP flows and callback networking**  
    Priority: **high**  
    Port GitHub Copilot, Anthropic, Google, and OpenAI Codex OAuth HTTP paths plus callback-server networking to Zig 0.16 APIs. Preserve credential ownership boundaries and response-body limits. Validate with utility/auth tests and mock callback-server tests, not external login E2E.

22. **Migrate WebSocket transport networking**  
    Priority: **normal**  
    Port WebSocket connection setup, stream read/write, nonce/mask generation, and network error handling through the networking/random wrappers. Preserve frame parsing and existing transport interfaces. Add or explicitly defer full `Sec-WebSocket-Accept` value verification, since current behavior only checks header existence, and document that `wss://` TLS remains unsupported post-migration unless the PR adds TLS support.

23. **Run full unit and mock E2E validation on Zig 0.16.0**  
    Priority: **urgent**  
    Run all grouped unit test steps, including `test-unit-makai-cli`, plus mock-based protocol E2E on Zig 0.16.0. Run required CI-level TS SDK validation if still required by PR CI. Stabilize failures and CI timing without adding external provider E2E requirements, and validate CLI output formatting, exit codes, and auth-flow prompts as part of the acceptance gate for compile/test parity.

24. **Update documentation, migration notes, and cleanup transitional code**  
    Priority: **normal**  
    Update developer docs, build instructions, changelog/release notes, and downstream migration notes to reflect Zig 0.16.0. Specifically update `CLAUDE.md` from "Requires Zig 0.15.2" to "Requires Zig 0.16.0" and add guidance for consumers depending on Makai public types/constructors. Remove obsolete Zig 0.15.2-only comments or dead compatibility paths while preserving wrappers that remain useful.

- Building or maintaining a libxev-to-`std.Io` adapter.
- Waiting for upstream libxev `std.Io` support before the initial migration.
- Keeping libxev solely because it is declared today; Phase 1 removes it because the dependency audit found no active source/build usage.
- Adding new providers, transports, OAuth flows, or agent features.
- External provider E2E stabilization or new secret-dependent tests.
- Broad performance optimization unrelated to compile/test parity.
- Changes to GitHub repository rules, admin bypass, or direct local-root modifications beyond instructed sync operations.

## Decision log

| Decision | Status for dispatch | Earliest blocked work item | Notes |
|---|---|---:|---|
| Default `std.Io` backend and ownership model | Binding default set; final backend selection recorded in work item 1 | 1 | Phase 0 wrappers MUST NOT expose `std.Io` in public APIs; public constructors use Makai context/default-I/O patterns, internal helpers may accept explicit handles. |
| Branch strategy | Decided | 9 | Use main-branch path with a first green Zig 0.16 PR; no long-lived integration branch unless this plan is revised. |
| libxev dependency posture | Decided | 9 | Remove libxev in Phase 1; current scan shows no active source/build usage beyond `build.zig.zon`. |
| Zig 0.15.2 source compatibility after Phase 1 | Decided | 9 | Not required after compiler switch; public API changes must be documented in migration notes. |
| Provider HTTP rollout shape | Decided | 18 | Shared abstraction + one proving provider, then OpenAI/Azure, then Anthropic/Google/Ollama. |
| Secure randomness enforcement | Decided | 14 | Phase 0 may add non-failing inventory only; enable failing `check-zig-patterns.sh` guardrails after random call sites migrate in work item 14. Both PKCE modules must migrate to secure entropy. |
| Credential memory zeroing | Known security debt; address or explicitly defer | 16 | `Credentials.deinit()` and `ProviderAuth.deinit()` currently free sensitive slices without zeroing; work item 16 must either fix this while touching storage or file a named follow-up. |

## Open questions

1. Does Zig 0.16.0 preserve `std.time.milliTimestamp`/`nanoTimestamp`, or should all usage move immediately to wrapper implementations backed by `std.Io.Timestamp`/`Io.Clock`? Earliest blocked work item: **13**.
2. Which provider should serve as the proving provider for the shared HTTP abstraction PR? Earliest blocked work item: **18**.
